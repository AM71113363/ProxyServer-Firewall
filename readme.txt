//First Run
1.Phone and PC have to be connected to the same local network

3.Click [ START ].
4.Click [ STOP ] when DONE.
5.Add HOST or IP to BlackList(see the photo in this directory)

// after first run
1.If you have filter you must Drag-Drop it before starting Proxy
2.Save filters after exiting App( if you want to save changes)
IMPORTANT:
if HOSTNAME to block is "abcd" the Proxy will block all hostames "*abcd" "abcd*" "*abcd*"
same this for IP  "111.001"   will block all IP  "*111.001" "111.001*" "*111.001*"

To prevent RAM USAGE you must restart the APP after [ STOP ] to run it again.
